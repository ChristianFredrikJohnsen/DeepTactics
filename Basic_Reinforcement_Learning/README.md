# Basic Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning Implementations

Welcome to the Basic Reinforcement Learning section! This folder focuses on implementing the Q-learning algorithm for different Gymnasium environments.


## 📖 About Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. The algorithm maintains a table (Q-table) that updates Q-values, which represent the quality of actions, as it explores the environment.

## 🌍 Environments

- **CartPole-v1**: Balancing a pole on a moving cart.
- **Acrobot**: A two-link pendulum, where the goal is to swing the pendulum to a certain height.
