## Introduction

This project was inspired by [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)
We recommend starting here to gain a solid foundation in reinforcement learning principles.

The end goal is to make some DQN-implementation which can play connect4 at a decent level.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChristianFredrikJohnsen/DeepTactics
    ```

2. Navigate to the `Introduction` directory and start with the introductory assignments.

## Repository Structure

- `Introduction/`: Contains introductory lectures and assignments.
- `Basic_Reinforcement_Learning/`: Code examples for basic RL algorithms in Gym environments.
- `Advanced_Reinforcement_Learning/`: More advanced topics like DQN.
- `Connect_four/`: Abandoned first attempt at a connect4 AI.
- `Connect_four2/`: Reinforcement learning algorithm playing the classic game!
- `Resources/`: Additional reading material and references.
